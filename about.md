My name is Dani Solomon. I specialize in concept art, character design, and illustration. I enjoy writing, especially blog posts for Geeks OUT! that can be found here. In my free time I love singing and playing the ukulele.

If you are interested in hiring me or if you have any questions, please contact me through email at dani.b.solomon@gmail.com.
