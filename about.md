![cool game]({{ site.github.url }}/img/selfie_cat.jpg)

I'm a concept artist, character designer, and illustrator from Massachussets.

I graduated from Fitchburg State University in 2017 with a Bachelor of Science in Game Design and a Minor in Studio Art.

In my free time I love playing video games (especially rhythm/music games), singing, learning songs on my ukulele, and reading tarot and oracle cards.

If you have any questions or are interested in hiring me, please contact me through my email, dani.b.solomon@gmail.com.
