I graduated from Fitchburg State University in 2017 with a B.S. in Game Design and a Minor in Studio Art.

My resume is linked [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9txvnm8y54yd7hw/Dani%20Solomon%20Resume.pdf?dl=0)!

In my free time I love playing video games (especially rhythm/music games), singing, learning songs on ukulele, and reading tarot and oracle cards.
