Working at [MidBoss](https://midboss.com/) was my first job in the game industry. I was part of a few game projects working various roles: Lead Game Designer, Lead Environment Concept Artist, Senior Scripter, Assistant Writer, QA Tester, Project Coordinator, Marketing Assistant, VO Timer. These multiple roles had me doing all sorts of tasks: concept art of environments and characters, set construction, scripting, QA testing, minigame design, sidequest design, puzzle design, storyboarding, world building, character arc development, project management, and creating and organizing pitch decks. Being able to try my hand at these multiple areas of game development alongside coworkers who were always willing to answer questions and help me learn boosted my growth as a game developer.

Below are concept sketches I created during my time at MidBoss.

Apartment building and rooms inside of an apartment:
