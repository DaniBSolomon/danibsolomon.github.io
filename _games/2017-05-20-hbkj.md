Happy Birthday, Kai-Junior! (HBKJ!) was created for my senior year capstone at Fitchburg State University. It was developed over the span of about 5 months with a nine person team that was mentored by Ichiro Lambe of Dejobaan Games. I was an Art Lead and Concept Artist for the project.

Here are character designs I made when the game originally had kaiju outside of eggs. They are posed from behind because the game was going to be third-person view of the character and the back needed to look cool.
