Happy Birthday, Kai-Junior! (HBKJ!) was created for my senior year capstone at Fitchburg State University. HBKJ! is an action-puzzle game where players control a hatching kaiju monster egg that must roll around destroying a city so that it can fully break open it's shell. It was developed over the span of about 4 months with a nine person team that was mentored by Ichiro Lambe of Dejobaan Games. I was an Art Director, Concept Artist, and Texture Artist for the project.

While the game was not completed, this project helped me build on the skills I learned throughout college and gave me the opportunity to learn what working in a shared office space is like.

Here are character designs I made when the game was originally a different concept that had kaiju outside of eggs.
