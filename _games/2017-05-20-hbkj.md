Happy Birthday, Kai-Junior! (HBKJ!) was created for my senior year capstone at Fitchburg State University. It was created over the span of about 5 months with a nine person team that was mentored by [Ichiro Lambe](https://twitter.com/dejobaan) of Dejobaan Games. I was an Art Lead and Concept Artist for the project.
