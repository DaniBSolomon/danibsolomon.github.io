Happy Birthday, Kai-Junior! (HBKJ!) was created for my senior year capstone at Fitchburg State University. It was developed over the span of about 5 months with a nine person team that was mentored by Ichiro Lambe of Dejobaan Games. I was an Art Lead and Concept Artist for the project.

The game went through many changes when it came to the mechanics of destroying the city. These concepts were all created before the team decided to go for a more cute approach of a tumbling egg.
