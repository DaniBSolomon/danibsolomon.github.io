Happy Birthday, Kai-Junior! (HBKJ!) was created for my senior year capstone at Fitchburg State University. It was developed over the span of about 5 months with a nine person team that was mentored by [Ichiro Lambe](http://www.ichiro.ninja/) of [Dejobaan Games](https://www.dejobaan.com/). I was an Art Director, Concept Artist, and Texture Artist for the project.

Here are character designs I made when the game was originally a different concept that had kaiju outside of eggs.
